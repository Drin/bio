# Diagrams
Any diagrams relevant to modeling of biology or bioinformatics entities will
go here. The idea is that there are many high-level entities that can be
modeled and interacted with, and diagrams are very helpful for this.

Keeping these diagrams close to this repository seems to make sense for now.
