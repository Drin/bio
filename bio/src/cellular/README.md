# Cellular Biology data types, structures, etc.
The cellular biology module will consist of data types, structures, etc.
representing cellular organelles and components, and potentially formats for
representing and transferring relevant data and metadata.

I am very much *not* in the know about cellular biology, so this will be built
out at a much later date.
