# bio
A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) crate of strong entities to represent data relevant to cellular and molecular biology.

## What about algorithms?
Please see [rust-bio](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio). The point of this crate is to distinguish between what I would like to develop in rust for bioinformatics/computational biology from what rust-bio attempts to implement and satisfy.

TL;DR:
* This crate will focus on data representation and manipulation
* Bioinformatics algorithms can be found in rust-bio
